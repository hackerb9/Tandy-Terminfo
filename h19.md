# Comparing Tandy Terminfo to Heathkit H19 

The Heathkit h19 terminfo is so similar to the one used by the Tandy
200 that it seems likely that when the Kyotronic-85 was first
developed, output was probably to an h19 before the screen hardware
was working.

The h19 was a VT52 clone with additional features that make it more
similar to a Tandy portable

* Standout Mode (reverse video) is enabled with
  <kbd>Esc</kbd><kbd>p</kbd>, disabled with
  <kbd>Esc</kbd><kbd>q</kbd>.

* Clear screen is <kbd>Esc</kbd><kbd>E</kbd>.

The H19 was also sold as the Zenith Z19. 


## Using a Tandy portable as an h19 emulator

Not possible because the Tandy portables (at least when running the
builtin TELCOM software) are missing too many features
* Scroll reverse
* Insert mode
* Different ACS characters,
* Special graphic characters
* Status line

## Using an h19 as a Tandy portable display

_May_ be possible depending on the program being run. There is an h19
terminal emulator written in Python available from
[http://h8.cowlug.org/h19term.php].

Many of the possible problems I can foresee with using an h19 as a
terminal are relatively minor or unlikely.

* h19 does not support any of the high ASCII characters from 128 to 255.

* h19 lacks insert_line and delete_line.

* Status line is completely different, so any program that tries to
  manipulate the status line using CHR$(27)+"T" or "U" will fail.

* h19 lacks save current line and restore saved line. However, those
  escape sequences were not well-documented and only worked on entire
  lines, so I would guess that their use was rare.

* h19 only understands '\EE' for clear screen. However, Model T's may
  send '\Ej' which does the same thing.

* The terminfo for the H19 shows that it does not have automatic left
  margins (backspace in the first column goes to the last column in
  the previous row). While that is how the Tandy portables work, it's
  not something programs often purposefully do. Also, I believe the
  terminfo database may be incorrect about the h19.

* Tandy portables have "destructive tabs"; that is, if the TAB
  character would pass over text, that text is erased. I suspect few
  programs relied on that feature. If they did, garbage characters
  might be left on the screen.

* I've only seen disable scrolling as useful for speeding up downloads
  in TELCOM. Was there any other reason for its existence?

* The inability to hide the cursor would be noticeable on an h19, but
  wouldn't prevent the program from running.

* Key codes sent by arrow keys are different.


## Nitty gritty comparison

Using infocmp it is possible to compare the terminfo file for the
Tandy portables to the h19. In fact that is how the analysis above was
done. What follows is the detailed data and some notes on the
differences.

### Notes

#### Differences which are not actual

* cursor_left on the h19 is defined as ^H. The VT52 and Tandy Terminfo
  specify '\ED'. But both of those codes are synonyms and they work
  the same on all three terminals.

* Tandy Terminfo's enter_reverse_mode is just an alias for
  enter_standout_mode. Likewise exit_attribute_mode for
  exit_standout_mode.

* newline is not defined in the h19 terminfo, but probably should be
  the same ('\r\n').

#### Differences which look like bugs but aren't

* has_status_line: What the Tandy portables call a "status line" is
  very different from a typical UNIX status line such as on the h19.

* auto_left_margin: The Tandy 200 goes up to the previous line when
  backspacing from column 0. 

* dest_tabs_magic_smso: This means "destructive tabs, magic so char"
  While primarily known as a glitch in the Teleray t1061 terminal,
  this problem also affects the Tandy computers. Specifically a Tab
  character will clear any text that it passes over. 

* backspaces_with_bs (OTbs): It actually is set in the Tandy terminfo,
  but modern versions of tic simply strip it out as it is an "obsolete
  termcap capability".

* scroll_reverse: Moves all text on the screen down one line. For no
  apparent reason, this does not work on the Tandy Portables. It would
  have been easy to implement using existing cursor controls: home +
  insert_line. Note that in TELCOM, the escape sequence for this,
  '\EI', actually sends the terminal answerback.
