  Many terminals have alternate
  character sets useful for
  forms-drawing. Terminfo and curses
  build in support for the drawing
  characters supported by the VT100,
  with some characters from the AT&T
  4410v1 added. This alternate character
  set may be specified by the `acsc`
  capability.

  The best way to define a new device's
  graphics set is to add a column to a
  copy of this table for your terminal,
  giving the character which (when
  emitted between smacs/rmacs switches)
  will be rendered as the corresponding
  graphic. Then read off the VT100/your
  terminal character pairs right to left
  in sequence; these become the ACSC
  string.
